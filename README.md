## About LunarRec

LunarRec is a RecNet server replacement for old Rec Room builds that multiple people can connect to. 

This project is similar to OpenRec Live or OpenLabs. If you're looking for a server that is more like OpenRec or Vault Server, check out [Rec.js](https://github.com/RealMCoded/Rec.js).
