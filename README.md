## About LunarRec

LunarRec is a server for Rec Room builds that multiple people can connect to. 

This project is similar to OpenRec Live or OpenLabs. If you're looking for a server that is more like OpenRec or Vault Server, check out [Rec.js](https://github.com/RealMCoded/Rec.js).

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with [Rec Room](https://recroom.com/) in any way, nor intends to infringe on their copyrights. Distributing old versions of Rec Room is copyright infringement, so that's why LunarRec does not come bundled with Rec Room at all [[source]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/859438464856490034/1137178290914869248/image.png).

The LunarRec Project is not responsible for what happens with user hosted servers.

## Guidelines

If you host a server that is public, you need to follow some guidelines.

***NOTE:*** These guidelines will change in the future as the project grows. 

1. All servers must follow the Rec Room Code of Conduct!
2. Do not claim to be an official RecNet server. Don't include the word "RecNet" in your server at all.
3. This project is under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE), which means you need to link back to the original source code if you make modifications (and choose to host it)
