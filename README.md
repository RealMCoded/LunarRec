## About LunarRec

LunarRec is a RecNet server replacement for old Rec Room builds that multiple people can connect to. 

This project is similar to OpenRec Live or OpenLabs. If you're looking for a server that is more like OpenRec or Vault Server, check out [Rec.js](https://github.com/RealMCoded/Rec.js).

## Features

- Free & Open Source (under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE) license).

- Fast & Efficient (depending on the hardware).

- Uses a SQLite database to store user data.

- Restrict connections to one version.

- Host your own customizable webpage to show server stats with [ejs](https://ejs.co/)! (Can be turned off in the config)

- Public API that shows Instance Name, Instance Description, Instance Host, Instance Owner, Target Version, ping, Registered Users, Online Users, Server Version.

- Hostable Discord bot to show server information and user stats!
